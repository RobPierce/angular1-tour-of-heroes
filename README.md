# Angular 1: Tour of heroes

This is the Tour of Heroes app as used in the Angular 2 tutorial. We start with the same app in Angular 1 and are migrating to Angular 2 step by step.
The setup is using Typescript, just like the Tour of Heroes app in the tutorial does.

## Development

1. `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server`

1. `npm install`

1. Run Webpack server which uses the TypeScript compiler and watch for changes `webpack-dev-server`

1. Uncomment the script tag that loads bundle.js


Alternative:

1. Run the TypeScript compiler and watch for changes `npm run tsc`

1. Open 2nd terminal and launch the app in the browser `npm start`

1. Uncomment the script tag that calls SystemJS.
